# CNA421_BankingBot
The scope of this project is to build a bot for a banking application with support for English and Spanish languages. The bot will be created using Amazon Lex which is a service for building conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text. Amazon Lex V2 console will be used to support multiple languages. To save on costs and management, AWS Lambda will be used to run the code for the bot. The goal of project is to have a bot which greets the user and responds to balance and transfer inquiries. This project is based off of hands-on projects from AWS https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/create-banking-bot-on-amazon-lex-v2-console/
